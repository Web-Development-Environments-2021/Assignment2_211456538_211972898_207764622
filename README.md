Added functionality:
1) Strong monster - marked as red, if you get hit by this monster it will take you two lifes and 20 points instead of 1 life and 10 points.(like the regular blue monster)
2) Time bonus - a hourglass that when you take it, it gives you 20 more seconds for the game
3) Health bonus - a heart that when you takes it, it gives you one more life
4) Disappearing candy - a candy that appears for short amount of time and changes positions and consuming it will give you 250 points.
5) Portals - on the game map there are portals that takes you to the other side of the map

End Game:
Win - when earning 500 points, or by taking all of the points distributed on the screen.

Note: the monsters sometimes might be in the same position so it might look like there are less monsters but they are actually one on each other.
